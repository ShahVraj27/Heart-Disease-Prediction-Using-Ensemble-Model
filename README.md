# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease in patients by analyzing various health metrics using machine learning models. The goal is to provide a reliable tool to assess heart disease risk through advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Key Features
Ensemble Method: Combines multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine) to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability.
Accuracy: Achieved a prediction accuracy of 95.6% using an ensemble model.
Comprehensive Evaluation: Includes AUC implementation, cross-validation, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.
Correlation Analysis: Used a correlation matrix to identify and manage multicollinearity in the dataset.
